            An open blogging platform built by developers, for learners.

            Sapphire is built on a simple belief:
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">
                education should be free, open, and accessible to everyone.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p class="text-base-content/70">
            We don’t believe in locking knowledge behind paywalls or
            subscription-only models. Platforms like Medium are great,
            but as programmers, we know we can build better systems —
            systems that respect openness, ownership, and learning.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base-content/70">
            Sapphire is our attempt to create a space where blogs, notes,
            and articles remain truly yours, forever.

                    </span>
                    — Readers will be able to consume blogs based on their
                    mood or preference, such as anime-style narration,
                    movie-like storytelling, or calm night-time reading modes.
                    The goal is to make learning feel natural, not forced.

                        Git-based CLI publishing
                    </span>
                    — A developer-first workflow where your blogs and notes
                    live as plain <code>.txt</code> or <code>.md</code> files
                    on your local system. Write locally, run a Git command,
                    and your content is published — simple, transparent,
                    and version-controlled.

        <p class="text-base-content/70">
            Sapphire is not just a platform — it’s a reminder that as
            programmers, we have the power to build systems aligned
            with our values. Knowledge should flow freely, and tools
            should empower creators, not restrict them.
